                    <p> China is a solar titan, it supplies the majority of the world's solar manufacturing
                    inputs and finished modules they <strong>manufacture over 80% of all the solar panels stages and hosts 9 of the Top 10 
                    PV manufacturers</strong> (https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/global-solar-ranking/).

        <p> When talking about renewables it's important to understand that countries are not buying an energy source, 
        unlike oil that will run out in a relatively small time, once you buy a solar panel it's good for the next
        25-35 years, a country is buying not a energy source, rather it's buying a technology that empowers it and makes it less dependent on others, 
        less exposed to global conflicts, i.e. makes energy sovereignty a possiblity, descentrilization. A such, solar beign a technology not a fuel it can power
        whatever the country needs, lights, factories, heaters, farms. And as Gabriel Davies has explained, (https://energyaccess.duke.edu/the-secret-of-the-energy-transition-why-solar-will-reshape-global-politics-and-be-bad-for-putin/)
        solar practicallt achieves the same efficiency in small as in giant solar farms, meaning small-scale local solar can compite with the more traditional
        centralized lare-scale power generation  </p>
        </div>
        <p>Thus as China's solar technology exports continue to grow, it's important to understand where are they going
            and how the countries importing them are using the technology, is it to become less reliable in other conuntries,
            to achieve internal carbon footprint policies or maybe to compete against China. In this post I will deep dive
            into where the money from solar is going, what are the big importers doing with it and where is China directly investing
            in solar farms

                        From the Top 5 importers of Chinese energy technology, 3 (India, Vietnam, Thailand) are direct 
                        competitors in the manufacturing scene and consistenly trying to win more market capitalzation
                        over China (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/india-mulls-1-billion-subsidy-plan-to-boost-solar-manufacturing)

                        We can see this clearly in the graph by looking at those countries that only import panels vs those
                        who are importing the intermediate techonologies. All of these are South East Asian, marking a trend
                        on what could be the future of the technology and economics of the region.

                        Unlike raw exports, China's direct investments tends to target countries. where:
                        - Energy transition is accelerating fast (UAE, Chile)
                        - Local capital markets are tight (Argentina)
                        - Grid expansion plans depend on foreign financing (Italy)
