China's Solar Exports 

Chema Galvez

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?
Yes, I originally tried to match China's solar exports to Europe's RD&D budget across time but there is a big outlier in Europe's data that it's most likely a data entry problem but this practically makes the dataset useless.

So I'm pivoting on tracking the (3) different exports of solar technology, where are they going. One of these technologies are solar wafer which is the raw (also we could say foundational) material for solar panels, with my visualizations I discovered that Asia is the contienent that is exporting more of these, which signals that there is another country/es manufacturing solar panels, so it would be interesting to track it down.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?
Previously I mentioned that there was not data for the US RD&D budget from 2016 onward, now that I explored the data further I also discovered that Europe's data has inconsistencies so I will ditch these dataframe completely.

Tip: The markdown syntax ![](image-name.png) will let you embed images directly, or you can number them and describe them by number in this file.

## What form do you envision your final narrative taking? (e.g. An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)
I would like to make an article, idk if it's to ambicious for the time we have but instead I can't make it then infographic
